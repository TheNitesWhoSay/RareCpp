Nf is a successor library to RareCpp - nf has stricter conventions, greater organization, and will house even more advanced applications of reflection.

Temporary accommodations: Due to C++26 all but certainly having language-level reflection... work on reimplementing reflection in nf was abandoned and emerging nf modules will, for the time being, depend on and at least partially share a repository with rarecpp.
